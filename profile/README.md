# Laboratory for Biomedical Computer Systems and Imaging

The main goals we are pursuing are:
- understand and describe the physiological phenomena,
- use computer in modeling and understanding of physiologic relationships,
- monitor physiologic events, graphically display anatomic details and physiologic functions, visualize and represent biomedical signal and imaging data,
- develop standardized databases to evaluate performance and robustness of recognition techniques, and to study physiologic mechanisms,
- characterize data, and establish the detection criteria and recognition techniques to automatize as much as possible analysis of bioelectric patterns, the examinations, procedures, and medical practice in order to improve the quality and reliability of the examinations,
- interpret the data and the results qualitatively and quantitatively,
- develop performance measures and protocols to evaluate detection techniques,
- develop biomedical information technologies and software,
- dynamic web-interface creation,
- responsive web design,
- responsive information visualization.
